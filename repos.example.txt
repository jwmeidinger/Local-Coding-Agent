# Example repos configuration file
# List one repository path per line
# Lines starting with # are ignored
# Supports ~/ for home directory
# Supports relative paths

# Your active projects:
~/Code/project1
~/Code/project2
~/Code/my-api-service
~/Code/web-frontend

# You can also use relative paths:
./project-a
./project-b

# This is a comment - this line is ignored
# ~/Code/archived-project  # This repo is commented out and will be ignored

# Ignore patterns work on repo names:
# If you have folders like:
#   ~/Code/project1 (active)
#   ~/Code/project2 (active)  
#   ~/Code/archive/old-project (ignored via pattern)
#   ~/Code/temp-test (ignored via pattern)
#
# Then use: --ignore "archive/*" "temp-*"
